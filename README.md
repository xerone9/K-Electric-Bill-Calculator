 Pakistan K-Electric Bill Calculator
 
 **Working**

When you receive bill note its reading and reading date in the app and press save.

The app will store the date and the units

Any time you can enter current meter reading from your meter and press calculate and it will tell you the following

 1- At which slab (Rate per Unit You Are).
 
 2- How many days passed (So that you can calculate how many days you need to control till next bill).
 
 3- How many units reamaining for next slab and what would the rate of that slab (if less then 50 units reamaining for next slab that line color turns RED).
 
 4- How much bill currently is generated.
 
 5- Once the month end and you receive new bill. Press reset and store new reading with new date.
 

**Note:**

Government is charging Fuel charges based on previous bills (So it vaires for customer to customer) so I put fuel charges rates on average approximate value the rest of the calculation is accurate.

Government is changing unit rates and slabs per bill policy rapidly so it is needed to be updated.

Few bills I checked there was an income tax deduction on them whereas in the most of the bills I reviewed there is no tax deduction so that "Income Tax Deduction" Part is not in the app.

**Issues:**

Someone asked me to add multiple meter feature so I added it. but I am unable to make a proper slider. So technically if you swipe the pages of app you will witneess that eventhough the meter reading is saved still is asking for enter meter reading after swiping (Top to down) because thats for another meter.

**Future Upgrades**

Will upload it on playstore and update the rates as per government policy on each every single update by governemtn but currently ther are charging fuel charges from old bills so the calculation is not 100% accurate so I'll wait until government stop charging fuel charges they said they'll charge fuel charges for 2 years and then they wont charge it
